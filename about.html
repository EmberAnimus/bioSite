                    <h1>More About Me</h1>
                    <p>I grew up in a small town with a family that instilled the love of reading in me at a young age. 
                        I struggled to learn how to read and write early on, but my family was very supportive and didn't give up on me. 
                        This made me love reading which evolved into a passion of wanting to write my own stories. 
                        I started taking writing more seriously when I got out of college. 
                        Eventually, I created a buisness in the midst of the pandemic. This developed into my current publishing buisness.</p>

                    <p>I love anime and travel which opened up my perspective on the world. 
                        I have always enjoyed learning about other culutres, but because of anime I have had a deep fascination with Japan. 
                        This fascination eventually progressed into writing my first novel, which takes place in Japan. 
                        My first novel is the culmination of over twenty years of dreaming, writing, learning, growing, and overcoming my personal struggles.</p>
