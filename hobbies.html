                    <h1>ASMR</h1>
                    <p>ASMR is a little bit of a niche area, but also in high demand. It stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, and it is usually sensation of tingling that can occur when you hear certain "triggers". 
                        It is a pleasant form of paresthesia and has been compared to auditory-tactile synesthesia. </p>
                    <p>I enjoy both producing and receiving ASMR. Originally I just listened to various ASMR artists to help me relax, destress, or sleep - and it helped wonders. 
                        Recently, however, I've been wanting to give back to the community. As a result, I started producing my own ASMR content and growing my brand. 
                        It's been an outstanding experience and I hope to continue helping others! </p>

                    <h1>Writing</h1>
                    <p>Growing up, I loved to read. Initially there were some struggles, but as I continued to read, I overcame them. 
                        As a result, I developed the desire to write my own book someday. 
                        At first I wrote on occasion, but once I graduated from college, I started to take it more seriously. 
                        I researched various things related to my books to make them more accurate and immersive.</p>
                    <p>Finally, last year, I published my first book titled <em>Ikigai: Ichirou's Journey</em>. Since then, I've been working on building my brand and publishing other works. 
                        I aim to publish another book before the end of the year and to grow my audience. 
                        Eventually, I hope to make enough from writing to be my main source of income.

                    <h1>Crafts</h1>
                    <p>I love writing novels but sometimes you need a mental break. In my downtime I like making crafts for my buisness and family as well.
                        I have many crafty hobbies that I've picked up over the years. Some examples are painting, soap-making, cosplay design, and other small crafts like bookmarks.
                        I enjoy creating things, and find pleasure when people use them. 
                        My favourite part is suprising someone with a handmade gift that they weren't expecting but are thrilled to recieve.
