                    <h1>Traveling</h1>
                    <p>Laurel Lake is very scenic and relaxing. I have a lot of fond memories there. It's beautiful and close enough to travel to. </p>
                    <p>For Yorkshire, I really liked the history and landscape. I also enjoyed the Lodge I stayed at with my family.
                    The Lodge, which was created to look like a castle, was actually used as the house for the reservoir gatekeeper.
                    The Lodge was near Pateley Bridge, A beautiful and historic little town. </p>
                    <p>Walking through the sheep farms was fascinating. Everything in England had a deep-rooted history, which was incredible.</p>
                    <p>With Japan I loved Kyoto, it was very beautiful and deeply rooted in history. 
                    While there were a lot of fun experiences in Kyoto, the two that stood out to me the most were: Weaving my own fabric on a Japanese loom and visiting Nij≈ç castle. </p>
                    <p>Kessenuma was touching and surreal as there was a mix of community and camaraderie alongside grief. The town still had quite a bit of damage and destruction from the tsunami in 2011. 
                    We had the opportunity to spend time with a family of Monks and learn more about their traditions, such as meditation and family practices.</p>

                    <h1>My Husband and I</h1>
                    <p>My husband and I met at a Magic the Gathering draft tournament hosted by our local card shop. When we faced, I had no chance, as he outplayed me at every turn. 
                        Even though he didn't win the tournament, I still hold his victory against him to this day. After the tournament, we exchanged numbers, and the rest was history.</p>
                    <p>We met 5 years ago, but have been married for a little more than 2.5 years now. 
                        It's been a wonderful experience and we have many wonderful memories of the beach, Japan, our cruise, and more. 
                        I look forward to many more years together and seeing what the future holds.</p>

                    <h1>My Buisness</h1>
                    <p>I started making masks during the pandmic. 
                        As time went on, the demand lessened and I reshaped my business into what it is today: selling my novels and book accesories.</p>
                    <p>One of the more difficult parts of running the business, however, is balancing time. 
                        I essentially work two full-time jobs, one in retail and the other running my business. 
                        Sometimes it's hard to do all the things that have to be done, alongside figuring out some of the other issues that come up along the way.</p>
                    <p>While some aspects of the business have been difficult, it has also been extremely rewarding. 
                        It's awesome to see people enjoy the works I write and the crafts I create. The best part about it is being my own boss.
                        I can make the changes I need to make when I want to make them, and being able to have the freedom to do things at my own pace is liberating.</p>
